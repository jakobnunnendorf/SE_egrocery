# SE_egrocery
Our project for Software Engineering at Yale-NUS
Team members: Abdullah, Marc, Jakob, Joshua, Pache
Deadline:   By March - Implementation & Testing
            26/03/23+ - Project Presentation
            April - Final Report

## Objective:
Create an e-grocery system that allows users to shop for grocery items, put them in a basket, (login) and purchase them online.

## Deliverables:
- Requirement
- Design
- Test Cases
- Documentation
- Software

## Phases of Software Process
1. Inception - Software product is conceived and defined
2. Planning - Initial schedule and resources are determined
3. Requirements Analysis - Specify what the application must do; answers “what?”
4. Design - Specify the parts and how they fit; answers “how?”
5. Implementation - Write the code
6. Testing - Execute the application with input test data

## Setup

### Initial Student Team Meeting: General Issues
1. Set agenda and time limits.
2. Choose the team leader. 
3. Get everyone’s commitment to required time and work ethics
– Define an expected average number of hours per week
– Gather dates of planned absences
4. Take a realistic census of team skills
– Common problem: inflated programming skill claims
5. Begin forming a vision of the application
6. Decide how team will collaborate and communicate
7. Take meeting minutes with concrete action items.
